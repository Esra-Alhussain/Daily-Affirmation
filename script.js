//Here's a brief explanation of the three states a Promise can be in:
/*
Pending: The initial state; the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.

 Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow you to handle the result (or error) in a more organized and readable way.*/
//.then(response => response.json())   
  // Step 3: Handle the JSON data obtained from the response
  //"when the JSON parsing is successful, take the resulting data and log it to the console
//.then(data => console.log(data))
  // Step 4: Handle any errors that may occur during the fetch operation
//.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

/*
In JavaScript, the catch block is part of the Promise chaining mechanism. When you chain then and catch methods after a Promise, they are executed in a specific order.

Here's how it works:

The fetch function returns a Promise.
The first then block is executed if the Promise is resolved (i.e., the HTTP request is successful). It takes the Response object and transforms it in some way (in this case, with response.json()).
If there are no errors in the then block (for example, if the JSON parsing is successful), the next then block is executed, which handles the parsed data.
If there is any error at any point in the Promise chain (whether in the initial fetch, in the JSON parsing, or anywhere else), the control jumps to the nearest catch block.
So, if there's an error in the fetch operation or in the subsequent processing of the response (like JSON parsing), the control will skip directly to the catch block. This is the power of Promises and the catch block â€“ they provide a clean way to handle errors in asynchronous code.
